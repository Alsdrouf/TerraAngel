<h2>
Installation
</h2>

---
To install, clone the github repo

```git clone https://github.com/CEO-Chair/DotnetPatcher.git --recursive```

To quickstart as x64, run `fast_start_x64.bat`, and as x86 `fast_start_x86.bat`

Or, manually build `TerraAngelSetup` and run `TerraAngelSetup.exe -auto` or `TerraAngelSetup.exe -decompile -patch` and build TerraAngel, and then run `TerraAngelSetup.exe -prebuild`

<h2>
Development
</h2>


To develop the client itself, after cloning the github repo
run  `fast_start_x64.bat` or `fast_start_x86.bat`

This will create a `src` directory

In this directory, there will be some folders, the one we're interested in the `src\TerraAngel`

This folder contains the client code

Making any changes to it and running `fast_diff.bat` will update the patches folder

You can then push a new commit or make a pull request to contribute to the repository
